"""MWE of a pydantic/FastAPI problem, kept for safety

Class-based dependencies in modules with `from __future__ import annotations`
fail if they have sub-dependencies, because the global namespace is not found by
pydantic. The work-around was to add a line to each class definition:
```
__globals__ = globals()
```
This bakes in the global namespace of the module, and allows FastAPI to correctly
traverse the dependency tree.

This is related to https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/issues/4557 and may have
been fixed upstream in FastAPI.

The tests in this module were written while I was figuring this out: they mostly
test things from FastAPI that obviously work, but I will leave them in here as
mitigation against something changing in the future.
