Generated documentation
=======================

LabThings describes its HTTP API in two ways: with a :ref:`wot_td` and with an OpenAPI_ document.

OpenAPI_ is a standard way to describe an HTTP interface. It lists all of the possible HTTP requests that may be made, along with a description of each one, and a description of the possible responses.

Each :ref:`wot_thing` is documented by a Thing Description, which is a JSON document describing all of the ways to interact with that Thing. The WoT_ standard defines the `Thing Description`_ and includes a JSON Schema against which it may be validated.

Thing Description documents are higher-level than OpenAPI_ and focus on the capabilities of the Thing, rather than the HTTP endpoints. In general you would expect more HTTP endpoints than there are interaction affordances, so in principle client code based on a Thing Description should be more meaningful. However, OpenAPI is a much more widely adopted standard and so both forms of documentation are generated by LabThings-FastAPI.
