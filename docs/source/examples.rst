Examples
========

For a simple example `.Thing` and instructions on how to serve it, see the :ref:`tutorial`\ .

For more complex examples, there is a useful collection of `.Thing` subclasses implemented as part of the `OpenFlexure Microscope`_ in the `things`_ submodule. This includes control of a camera and a translation stage, as well as various software `.Thing`\ s that integrate the two.
