# LabThings-FastAPI Examples

This folder used to contain some example python scripts, however these were not tested and were going stale. For a simple example, please see the tutorial section of [readthedocs].

For some more complicated `Thing`s already written for handling cameras, see the [OpenFlexure Microscope] - you can find the relevant [camera Thing code] there.
