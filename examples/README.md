# LabThings-FastAPI Examples

The files in this folder are example code that was used in development and may be helpful to users. It's not currently tested, so there are no guarantees as to how current each example is. Some of them have been moved into `/tests/` and those ones do get checked: at some point in the future a combined documentation/testing system might usefully deduplicate this.

Two camera-related examples have been removed, there are better `Thing`s already written for handling cameras as part of the [OpenFlexure Microscope] and you can find the relevant [camera Thing code] there.

To run these examples, it's best to look at the tutorial or quickstart guides on our [readthedocs] site.
