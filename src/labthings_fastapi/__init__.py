r"""LabThings-FastAPI.

This is the top level module for LabThings-FastAPI, a library for building
:ref:`wot_cc` devices using Python. There is documentation on readthedocs_,
and the recommended place to start is :doc:`index`\ .

.. _readthedocs: https://labthings-fastapi.readthedocs.io/

This module contains a number of convenience
imports and is intended to be imported using:

.. code-block:: python

    import labthings_fastapi as lt

The example code elsewhere in the documentation generally follows this
convention. Symbols in the top-level module mostly exist elsewhere in
the package, but should be imported from here as a preference, to ensure
code does not break if modules are rearranged.

# The symbols in __all__ are part of our public API.
# They are imported when using `import labthings_fastapi as lt`.
# We should check that these symbols stay consistent if modules are rearranged.
# The alternative `from .thing import Thing as Thing` syntax is not used, as
# `mypy` is now happy with the current import style. If other tools prefer the
# re-export style, we may switch in the future.
