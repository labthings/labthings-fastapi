"""Retrieve the `.ThingServer` object.

This module provides a function that will retrieve the `.ThingServer`
based on the `fastapi.Request` object. It may be used as a dependency with
``Annotated[ThingServer, Depends(thing_server_from_request)]``.

See dependencies_ for more information on the dependency mechanism,
and things_from_things_ for more on how `.Things` interact.

.. note::

    This module does not provide a ready-made annotated type to use as a
    dependency. Doing so would mean this module has a hard dependency on
    `.ThingServer` and cause circular references. See above for the
    annotated type, which you may define in any code that needs it.

.. note::

    The rationale for this function is that we want to make sure `.Thing`
    instances only access the server associated with the current request.
    This means that we use the `fastapi.Request` to look up the
    `fastapi.FastAPI` app, and then use the app to look up the `.ThingServer`.

    As each `.Thing` is connected to exactly one `.ThingServer`, this may
    become unnecessary in the future as the server could be exposed as a
    property of the `.Thing`.
