"""Thing Description module.

This module supports the generation of Thing Descriptions. Currently, the top
level function lives in `.Thing.thing_description`,
but most of the supporting code is in this submodule.

A Pydantic model implementing the Thing Description is in
`.thing_description._model`, and this is used to generate our TDs -
using a `pydantic.BaseModel` helps make sure any TD errors get caught when
they are generated in Python, which makes them much easier to debug.

We also use the JSONSchema provided by W3C to validate the TDs we generate, in
`.thing_description.validation`, as a double-check that we are standards-compliant.

    :ref:`wot_td` represents datatypes with DataSchemas, which are almost but not
    quite JSONSchema format. There are two main tasks to convert them:

    Resolving references
    --------------------

    JSONSchema allows schemas to be replaced with `{"$ref": "#/path/to/schema"}`.
    Thing Description does not allow this. `dereference_jsonschema_dict` takes a
    `dict` representation of a JSON Schema document, and replaces all the
    references with the appropriate chunk of the file.

    Converting union types
    ----------------------

    JSONSchema can represent `Union` types using the `anyOf` keyword, which is
    called `oneOf` by Thing Description.  It's possible to achieve the same thing
    in the specific case of array elements, by setting `items` to a list of
    `DataSchema` objects. This function does not yet do that conversion.

    This generates a copy of the document, to avoid messing up `pydantic`'s cache.

    This function runs recursively: to start with, only ``d`` should be provided
    (the input JSONSchema). We will use the other arguments to keep track of
    recursion as we convert the schema.

    :param d: a JSONSchema representation of a datatype.
    :param root_schema: the whole JSONSchema document, for resolving references.

    :param recursion_limit: how deeply this function is allowed to recurse.
