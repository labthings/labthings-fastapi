    This exception is called if an Action is called or
    a `.DataProperty` is updated on a Thing that is not
    connected to a ThingServer.

    A server connection is needed to manage asynchronous behaviour.

    `.Thing` instances are also only assigned a ``path`` when they
    are added to a server, so this error may be raised by functions
    that implement the HTTP API if an attempt is made to construct
    the API before the `.Thing` has been assigned a path.

    This exception is called when a function assumes the ThingServer is

    code in the async event loop.
