support a stub version of the class in a separate package, so

    This class should encapsulate the code that runs a piece of hardware, or provides
    a particular function - it will correspond to a path on the server, and a Thing
    Description document.

    ## Subclassing Notes

    * `__init__`: You should accept any arguments you need to configure the Thing
      in `__init__`. Don't initialise any hardware at this time, as your Thing may
      be instantiated quite early, or even at import time.
    * `__enter__(self)` and `__exit__(self, exc_t, exc_v, exc_tb)` are where you
      should start and stop communications with the hardware. This is Python's standard
      "context manager" protocol. The arguments of `__exit__` will be `None` unless
      an exception has occurred. You should be safe to ignore them, and just include
      code that will close down your hardware. It's equivalent to a `finally:` block.
    * Properties and Actions are defined using decorators: the `@thing_action` decorator
      declares a method to be an action, which will run when it's triggered, and the
      `@thing_property` decorator (or `ThingProperty` descriptor) does the same for
      a property. See the documentation on those functions for more detail.
    * `title` will be used in various places as the human-readable name of your Thing,
      so it makes sense to set this in a subclass.

    There are various LabThings methods that you should avoid overriding unless you know
    what you are doing: anything not mentioned above that's defined in `Thing` is
    probably best left along. They may in time be collected together into a single
    object to avoid namespace clashes.
