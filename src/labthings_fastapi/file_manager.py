"""Manage files created by Actions

**This module is deprecated in favour of `labthings_fastapi.outputs.blob`**

Simple actions return everything you need to know about them in their return value,
which can be serialised to JSON. More complicated actions might need to return
more complicated responses, for example files.

The FileManager class is responsible for managing files created by actions. It will
handle finding a temporary storage location, and making it possible to retrieve the
files via the Invocation object.
