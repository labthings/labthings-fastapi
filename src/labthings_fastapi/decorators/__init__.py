"""
The decorators in this module mark the Interaction Affordances of a Thing.

LabThings generates a "Thing Description" to allow actions, properties, and
events to be used by client code. The descriptions of each "interaction
affordance" rely on docstrings and Python type hints to provide a full
description of the parameters, so it's important that you use these
effectively.

If you have a complex datatype, it's recommended to use a `pydantic` model
to describe it - this is often the case for complicated properties or events.
For actions, a model is created automatically based on the function's
signature: if you want to add descriptions or validators to individual
arguments, you may use `pydantic.Field` to do this.

## Actions

You can add an Action to a Thing by declaring a method, decorated with
`@thing_action`. Parameters are not usually needed, but can be supplied to set
various options.

## Properties

As with Actions, Properties can be declared by decorating either a function, or
an attribute, with `@thing_property`. You can use the decorator either on
a function (in which case that
function acts as the "getter" just like with Python's `@property` decorator).

## Events

Events are created by decorating attributes with `@thing_event`. Functions are
not supported at this time.
