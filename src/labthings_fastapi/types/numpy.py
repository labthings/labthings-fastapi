"""Basic support for numpy arrays in Pydantic models.

We define a type alias `.NDArray` which is a numpy array, annotated
to allow `pydantic` to convert it to and from JSON (as an array-of-arrays).

This should allow numpy arrays to be used without explicit conversion:

.. code-block:: python

    from labthings_fastapi.types.ndarray import NDArray


    def double(arr: NDArray) -> NDArray:
        return arr * 2  # arr is a numpy.ndarray

The implementation is not super elegant: it isn't recursive so has only been
defined for up to 6d arrays. Specifying the dimensionality might be a nice
touch, but is left for the future.

Complex numbers are currently not supported, again this is left for the future.

`.NDArray` "validates" `numpy.ndarray` objects by converting a nested list of
numbers into an `numpy.ndarray` using `numpy.asarray`\ . Similarly, it calls
`numpy.ndarray.tolist` to convert the array back into a serialisable structure.

The JSON Schema representation is a nested list up to 7 deep, which is cumbersome

In the future it would be good to replace this type with several types of
different, specified dimensionality. That would make for much less horrible
