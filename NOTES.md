# Docstring Review

In this PR, I intend to go through every function and check:
* That there is a docstring
* That it's formatted appropriately, using ReST

I will add missing docstrings as I go. I will note here any conceptual docs that are missing - probably looking through all the code is a good way to identify these. I may not add them in this PR, but will at least make an issue to flag them.

This file will be deleted before merging.

## Conceptual pages needed
